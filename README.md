# Atomic-Terms-Calculator
Calculating microstates and atomic terms using given electron configuration based on Russell-Saunders coupling scheme.

Guess everything is clear based on the programs own instructions!

Just keep in mind:
The program does support up to f5 valence electron configuration. Not like I couldnt add anymore configs, I just didnt feel any need :)
